My personal keyboard layout for OWLab Link65, Vertex Arc60, Ai03 Meridian, Haven 60, and Gray Studio bd60. Keyboards are all 60/HHKB layout except OWLab Link65.

Note: I'm using arc60 welding version now. `arc60h` is archived.

I believe that use left hand to do most frequent things.

First layer    ---> First layer right-hand arrow keys, windows management and F-Keys.
Second layer   ---> Mouse keys and Super keys combination.
Third layer    ---> F-Keys (F1 ~ F24) with Ctrl, Shift, Alt mapped in a more convenient way, and some system functions.
Fourth layer   ---> Left-hand arrow keys, for document navigation keys in normal text editors.
Fifth layer    ---> Symbol layers, include the enhancement of the arrow keys in first layer.

Layers here are not necessary.
Sixth layer    ---> Basic layer with arrow keys. (gaming)
Seventh layer  ---> Backup layer
